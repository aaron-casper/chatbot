You can come the easy way or the hard way, I don't care
I'd like to teach you a little nursery rhyme

I'm just a person, and I've got the new plague.  I'm wondering how I got this way
I drank some whiskey, I went and got laid.  Now I'm a person, just a person with AIDS

He's just a person with AIDS.  
I got what?

If you treat me like any old dude I'll try real hard not to go bleed on you
'Cause I'm a person, and I know what to do.  So stick around 'cause I'm gonna get screwed
yeah

Ooh, I'm dyin'!

I'm just a person, and you're a person like me.  Am I the victim of a conspiracy?
I drank some whiskey, I did some cocaine.  Now I'm a person in pain, pain, pain!


He's just a person with AIDS 
I got AIDS!
He's just a person with AIDS
He's just a person with AIDS 
The New Plague
AIDS

I've got AIDS
You've got AIDS
We've got AIDS
